# Wikid

Wikid compiles markdown wiki/blog posts into HTML files, including cross references, hyperlinks, and version control.

## File paths
- **text**: Source code, divided into subsections. One for search section.
- **html**: HTML code created by wikid
- **code**: Github code which is referenced in code

---

As for text formats, markdown is used. External links are written as `[link text](hyperlink)`, and internal links are written as `[link text]{reference name}`. References include equations, figures, tables, notes, sections, subsections, etc.

## To do
* Fix bugs in text
* Correct the fact that zero colors are printed as single digit
* Version numbering
